Docker Network: Connect Containers to other containers and connect containers to Host Machine.
Docker containers and services can be connected with each other.
Containers and Services don't need to be aware where they are deployed either it be in same host or multiple hosts
Container and Services can communicate, whether your docker hosts run linux, Windows, or a mix of OS.

Each Container connect to virtual private network called "bridge".
Bridge: This is default Network driver of Docker
Containers which are deployed in default bridge network will be able to communicate with each other by using the IP addresses.
