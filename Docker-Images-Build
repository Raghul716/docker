LABEL: Label added to iamge to organize iamges by project, record licensing information.

LABEL com.example.version="0.0.1-beta"

RUN: RUN instruction will execute any commands in a new layer on top of the current image and commit the results.

CMD: CMD instruction should be used to run the software contained by your image, Along with any arguments

CMD ["executable", "param1", "param2"]

EXPOSE: Expose instruction indicates the ports on which a container listens for connections.
