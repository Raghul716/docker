# Multi-Service Docker Compose Setup

This project sets up a multi-service application with both a Python web service and a Node.js application using Docker Compose. The project includes dynamic Docker builds for both services, with configurable environment variables and arguments.


## Overview

This project uses Docker Compose to manage two services:
1. **Node.js Application**: A simple Node.js application that logs its name and environment.
2. **Python Application**: A Python application that prints its version and environment.

Both services are configured to run with Docker, using specific Dockerfiles and environment settings
