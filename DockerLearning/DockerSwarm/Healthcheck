Health checks are exactly what they sound like - a way of checking the health of some resource.
Docker has inbuilt functionality to check the Container Health.
Docker health check can be applied in Docker Run Command, Docker File, Docker Service and Docker Stack.
Docker health-check define weather the service is working or not.

➤ HealthCheck instruction format:
HEALTHCHECK [option] CMD <command>: The command that sets the container health check.
➤ HEALTHCHECK instructions can check the health status when instantiating Docker containers.
➤ HEALTHCHECK Supports following Options:
➤ --interval=<interval>: The time interval between two health checks. The default value is 30 seconds.
➤ --timeout=<interval>: The timeout for running the health check command. The health check fails if the timeout is exceeded. The default value is 30 seconds.

➤ --retries=<number of times>: The container status is regarded as unhealthy if the health check fails continuously for a specified number of times. The default value is 3.
➤ --start-period=<interval>: The initialization time of application startup. Failed health check during the startup is not counted. The default value is 0 second.
➤ Verify the HEALTHCHECK of Docker Container
➤ Verify HEALTHCHECK of Docker Service


For eg:
docker container run -d --name postgres2 --health-cmd="pg_isready -U postgres || exit 1" postgres
docker service create --name postgresservice1 --health-cmd="pg_isready -U postgres || exit 1" postgres
