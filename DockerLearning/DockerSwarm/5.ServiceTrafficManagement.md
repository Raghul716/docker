Docker Swarm Global Traffic Management is related to "Routing Mesh".
Docker Swarm publish services on some ports and allow Outer world to access these services. This is called "Ingress routing Mesh".
The routing mesh enables each node in the swarm to accept connections on published ports for any service running in the swarm, even if there is no task running on the node.
