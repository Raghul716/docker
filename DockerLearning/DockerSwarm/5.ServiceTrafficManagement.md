Docker Swarm Global Traffic Management is related to "Routing Mesh".

Docker Swarm publish services on some ports and allow Outer world to access these services. This is called "Ingress routing Mesh".

The routing mesh enables each node in the swarm to accept connections on published ports for any service running in the swarm, even if there is no task running on the node.

The routing mesh routes all incoming requests to published ports on the available nodes to an active container.

Command we Executed :
docker service create --name drupal --network my_overlay -p 80:80 drupal 

Command is Like : -p <published_port>:<container_port>

<PUBLISHED_PORT> is the port where the swarm makes the service available

<CONTAINER_PORT> is the port where the container listens

Routing mesh listens on the published port for any IP address assigned to the node.
