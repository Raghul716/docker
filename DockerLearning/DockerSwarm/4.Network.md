Docker swarm has new Network Driver overlay Network.
The overlay network drives creates a distributed network among multiple Docker hosts.
Overlay Network allows containers to communicate inside a single swarm.
when you iniitialize a swarm or join a Docker Host to an existing swarm, two new networks are created on that Docker host:

# Ingress: 
Ingress is an overlay Network, Which handles control and data traffic related to swarm services.if swarm services are not connected with user defined overlay network it connects to ingress network.

# Bridge Network:
Bridge network called docker_gwbridge which connects the individual Docker node to the other node participating in the swarm.

# Rules
TCP Port 2377 for cluster management communications.
TCP and UDP port 7946 for communication among nodes.
UDP port 4789 for overlay network traffic.
Before create an pverlay network, docker swarm must be initialised on Node or join it to an existing swarm.
