Docker Swarm Help us to limit the Downtime in service update/Upgrade.

Its all became possible with Rolling Upgrade Approach.

Service Upgrade Provides rolling upgrade of replicas/containers with Zero-downtime.
➤ Service Upgrade Replace Containers in practical
➤ Some examples of Service Upgrade
➤ Enhance the Version of your Deployed Service
docker service update - -image <Imagename> <servicename>


➤ Swarm Update in Stack File
➤ Edit YML file and deploy the same file
docker stack deploy -c <yml file> <servicename>
➤ Start Some NGINX Service on some port
docker service create -p 80:8080 - -name <service_name> <nginx Image:version>
 ➤ Scale service Horizontally
docker service scale <servicename> = <number of replicas>

➤ Enhance Deployed Image Version
docker service update - -image <Nginximage:version>
<servicename>
➤ Change Port of running service
docker service update - -publish-rm <old_port> - -publishadd <new_port>:80
